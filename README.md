# C-String-Project

This was a project that was done during CS102 as part of the class.
We worked in the lab in teams of two, creating our own string class under the tutelage of our professor.
Part of the work involved creating unit tests to make sure our string classes were working as intended.
We'd then share the unit tests / make giant files with all of our classmates unit tests to make sure we could pass them all.
I'm not going to be sharing any of my classmate's tests because that code isn't mine and it'd be unethical to share it without their permission.
